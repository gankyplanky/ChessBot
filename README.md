# ChessBot
A simple chess bot written in c# using Visual Studio 2022 and the WPF system. This project is made as a uni assignment and will not be maintained. 
The bot itself is rather simple using alpha-beta prunning algorithm working with 2D integer arrays representing the board and doing move calculations on the arrays.

# Test it
If you want to try out the bot (you will win its not that great) simply clone the repo.
```
git clone https://github.com/gankyplanky/ChessBot.git
```
After, navigate to 'ChessBot/bin/Release/net6.0-windows/publish/' and execute the ChessBot.exe.
As this is a WPF app it can run on Windows no problem, but you will have to use WINE for linux (untested for linux).
